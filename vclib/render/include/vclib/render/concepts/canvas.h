/**
 * @brief The CanvasConcept concept is used to check if a class satisfies the
 * requirements of the Canvas concept.
 *
 * Each class that satisfies this concept can be used as a canvas in the
 * @ref vcl::RenderApp class (second template parameter). The Canvas class is
 * responsible for managing the render backend and the surface where the Drawer
 * objects can draw.
 *
 * It is a class that is templated on the RenderApp class (using the CRTP
 * pattern). The class is then allowed to access the member functions of the
 * public members of the @ref vcl::RenderApp class and all the members of the
 * @ref vcl::RenderApp::CNV inner class.
 *
 * @par Constructors
 *
 * The class must have the following constructors:
 * - `CanvasType(void* winId, uint width, uint height)`: Constructor that
 * initializes the canvas with the window id (the platform dependent
 * identifier of the window where the canvas will be placed) and the initial
 * size of the canvas.
 * - `CanvasType(void* winId, uint width, uint height, void* displayId)`: Same
 * as the previous constructor, but also takes the display id (the platform
 * dependent identifier of the display where the window is placed - this
 * parameter is required only on linux platforms, it can be left nullptr in
 * other platforms).
 *
 * @par Inner types
 *
 * The class must have the following inner types:
 * - `CallbackReadBuffer`: A type that represents the signature of the callback
 * function that will be called when the depth value is read from the depth
 * buffer of the Canvas. See the `onReadDepth` member function for more details.
 *
 * @par Member functions
 *
 * The class must have the following member functions:
 * - `size() -> Point2Concept`: Returns the size of the canvas, as a Point2i
 * object having the width as x() and height as y().
 * - `viewId() -> uint`: Returns an unsigned integer that represents the view
 * id of the canvas. The view id is used to identify the canvas when drawing
 * content on it, and it is passed to the Drawer objects at each draw call.
 * - `setDefaultClearColor(const Color& color) -> void`: Sets the default clear
 * color of the canvas to the specified color.
 * - `onInit() -> void`: Called when the canvas is initialized. This function
 * is called by the RenderApp class when the WindowManager of the vcl::RenderApp
 * is initialized. This function should contain all the initialization calls
 * that cannot be done in the constructor (e.g. because the WindowManager
 * could not guarantee the initialization of the backend context in the
 * constructor).
 * - `onResize(uint width, uint height) -> void`: Called when the canvas is
 * resized. This function is called by the RenderApp class when the
 * WindowManager of the vcl::RenderApp is resized. The function should resize
 * the canvas to the new size.
 * - `onPaint() -> void`: Called when the canvas must be repainted. This
 * function is called by the RenderApp class when the WindowManager of the
 * vcl::RenderApp is repainted. The function should draw the content of the
 * canvas, by calling the vcl::RenderApp::CNV::draw() member function of the
 * RenderApp class.
 * - `onReadDepth(const vcl::Point2i& point, CallbackReadBuffer callback) ->
 * bool`: Called when a Drawer object asks to read the depth value at the
 * specified point on the canvas. The function should read the depth value at
 * the specified point and call the callback function with the depth value.
 * - `onScreenshot(const std::string& filename, uint width = 0, uint height = 0)
 * -> bool`: Called when a Drawer object asks for a screenshot of the canvas.
 * The function should take a screenshot of the canvas and save it to the
 * specified filename. If the width and height are specified, the screenshot
 * should be resized to the specified dimensions.
