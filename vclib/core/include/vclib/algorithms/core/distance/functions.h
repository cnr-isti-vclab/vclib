 * @brief Return a proper bounded distance function between a Obj1 object and an
 * Obj2 object.
 *
 * The returned function is a lambda function that takes in input two const
 * references of the desired types, a scalar that represents the bound, and
 * returns a scalar that is the distance between the two objects if it is less
 * than the bound. If the distance is greater than the bound, the distance was
 * not computed totally and should be discarded.
 *
 * This function is different w.r.t. the distFunction because the returned
 * function here takes three arguments: the two objects on which compute the
 * distance, and a scalar that represent the maximum distance that can be
 * returned. This value is used by some distance functions for performance
 * reasons: it allows to avoid several computation if a first distance does
 * already exceed the maximum value.
 *
 * If the bounded distance function is not defined, the standard distance
 * function will be used, and the bound parameter will be ignored.
 * If the distance function for your types is not defined, you can write your
 * own vcl::boundedDistance (or vcl::distance) overload that defines a proper
 * bounded distance function.
 *
 * @note The boundedDistFunction works only for non-pointer types, because
 * generally the overloads of vcl::distance and vcl::boundedDistance do not take
 * pointers as input. This means that you cannot ask for the distance function
 * between a vcl::Point3d and a vcl::Vertex*. If you are working with template
 * types that you don't know if they are pointers or not, you can do the

 * RemoveCVRefAndPointer<T2>, double>();
 * // obj1 is of type T1, obj2 is of type T2 (may be pointers or non-pointers)
