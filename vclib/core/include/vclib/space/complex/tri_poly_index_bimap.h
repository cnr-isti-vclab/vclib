 * @brief The TriPolyIndexBiMap class allows to store a bidirectional mapping
 * between a Polygon Mesh and a Triangle Mesh generated by the polygon mesh.
 *
 * The class stores, for each triangle index, the index of the polygon that
 * generated the triangle, and for each polygon, the first triangle index
 * generated by that polygon. Therefore, keep in mind that the mapping assumes
 * that, for each polygon that generates N triangles, the N triangles are
 * contiguous in the Triangle Mesh.
 *
 * Queries have O(1) complexity.
 * Insertion may have O(1) or O(n), depending on the size of the containers used
 * to store indices (same way of std::vector push_back() memeber function). You
 * can also reserve before, in order to be sure that the insertion will be O(1).
