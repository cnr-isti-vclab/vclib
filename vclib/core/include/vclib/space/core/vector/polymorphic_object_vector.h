 * @brief The PolymorphicObjectVector class is a container that stores a
 * collection of polymorphic objects, having a common base class T.
 *
 * The PolymorphicObjectVector class is a container that stores a collection of
 * polymorphic objects, having a common base class T. The class is designed to
 * work with objects that are cloneable, i.e., that implement the Cloneable
 * concept (they must implement a member function `clone()` that returns a
 * shared pointer that points to a newly created object).
 *
 * The container stores the objects as shared pointers to the base class.
 * All the member functions of this class that take a value of type T as
 * argument will clone the object before storing it in the container. This way,
 * the container will own a copy of the object, and the original object will
 * not be modified (as it is made normally on std::vector). To avoid cloning,
 * you can pass a shared pointer to the object.
 *
 * The size of the container can be either fixed or dynamic, depending
 * on the value of the template parameter `N`. If `N` is greater than or equal
 * to zero, the container will have a fixed size of N elements, and it will use
 * an array to store the elements. If `N` is less than zero, the container will
 * have a dynamic size, and it will use a vector to store the elements.
 *
 * @tparam T: The base class of the polymorphic objects stored in the container.
 * The class T must implement the Cloneable concept.
 * @tparam N: the size of the container. If `N` is greater than or equal to
 * zero, the container will have a fixed size of `N` elements, and it will use
 * an array to store the elements. If `N` is less than zero, the container will
 * have a dynamic size, and it will use a vector to store the elements.
