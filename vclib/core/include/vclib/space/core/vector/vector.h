 * @brief The Vector class is a generic container of objects of type `T`, that
 * could have fixed or dynamic size, depending on the templated size `N`.
 *
 * The Vector class is a container that can hold objects of type `T`. The size
 * of the container can be either fixed or dynamic, depending on the value of
 * the template parameter `N`. If `N` is greater than or equal to zero, the
 * container will have a fixed size of N elements, and it will use an array to
 * store the elements. If `N` is less than zero, the container will have a
 * dynamic size, and it will use a vector to store the elements. The Vector
 * class provides several member functions to manipulate the elements of the
 * container, such as getting and setting individual elements, filling the
 * container with a value, checking if the container contains a certain element,
 * and finding the index of a certain element.
 *
 * @tparam T: the type of the objects stored in the container.
 * @tparam N: the size of the container. If `N` is greater than or equal to
 * zero, the container will have a fixed size of `N` elements, and it will use
 * an array to store the elements. If `N` is less than zero, the container will
 * have a dynamic size, and it will use a vector to store the elements.
