     * @brief Compute the mean ratio of a triangle shape quality measure.
     *
     * Given three points \p p0, \p p1, \p p2 representing a triangle, the
     * function computes the mean ratio shape quality measure of the triangle.
     * The mean ratio is defined as 2 * sqrt(a * b) / (a + b), where a and b are
     * the eigenvalues of the M^tM transformation matrix into a regular simplex.
     * The mean ratio is a scalar value in the range [0, 1] that describes the
     * triangle quality, where 0 means the triangle is degenerate, and 1 means
     * it is perfectly equilateral.
     *
     * @param[in] p0 The first point of the triangle.
     * @param[in] p1 The second point of the triangle.
     * @param[in] p2 The third point of the triangle.
     * @return The mean ratio shape quality measure of the triangle.
     *
     * @note The function assumes that the three points are not collinear and
     * form a valid triangle. If the three points are collinear or form a
     * degenerate triangle, the function returns 0.
