/**
 * @brief The PointerContainerComponent is the base class for all the
 * components of VCLib that store a container of pointers to an Element.
 *
 * A component that inherits from this class will have all the features of the
 * @ref Component and @ref ContainerComponent classes, and will have access to
 * the implementations of updateElementPointers member functions, that should be
 * used by the Derived Component.
 *
 * For further details , please refer to the page @ref implement_component page.
 *
 * @tparam DerivedComponent: The type of the Derived Component. It is used to
 * implement the CRTP pattern.
 * @tparam COMP_ID: The id of the component. It is a value of the enum
 * ComponentIDEnum, or an integer value that is not already used by any other
 * component. It is used to identify the component at compile time.
 * @tparam Elem: The type of the Element of which the pointers are stored. E.g.
 * a VertexPointers component would have VertexType as Elem.
 * @tparam N: The size of the container: if >= 0 the size is static, if < 0 the
 * size is dynamic.
 * @tparam ParentElemType: The Parent Element type is used to get access to the
 * Element that has the component (and, in case, to the Mesh that has the
 * Element). If the component doesn't need to access the Element, this type can
 * be void. Note: if the component is vertical (or optional), this type cannot
 * be void.
 * @tparam VERT: Boolean that tells if the component is vertical. If the
 * component is vertical, this parameter must be true. Note: to be vertical,
 * this parameter must be true, and ElementType must be the type of the Element
 * that has the component (the 'parent' Element Type).
 * @tparam OPT: When a component is vertical, it could be optional, that means
 * that could be enabled/disabled at runtime. To make the component optional,
 * this template parameter must be true.
 * @tparam TTVN: "Tied To Vertex Number", this boolean tells whether the
 * component should leave liberty to control the size of the Container to the
 * user, or it should be tied to the vertex number and changed automatically
 * when the number of vertices changes. E.g. a AdjacentFaces component, if part
 * of a Face element, should be tied to the vertex number of the Face, meaning
 * that the number of face pointers should be always be the same of the number
 * of vertices. Setting this value to true will tie the size of this container
 * to the number of vertices.

     * This is necessary when, for example, the original container of Elements
     * has been reallocated. When this happens, the all the Elements have been
     * moved in another portion of memory, and all the pointers to that Elements
     * must be updated. Since in this container are stored pointers to Elements,

     * Element of the reallocated Container before the reallocation). We can
     * then compute, for each pointer, the difference w.r.t. the old address of
     * the first element of the Container, and update the the pointer
     * accordingly using the new base of the Container, which is computed
     * trough the parent mesh.
     *
     * When we perform an append operation, we need to update the pointers
     * taking into account also the offset: when we append a new element in a
     * container, only its pointers must be updated. To update from the old
     * pointers to the new ones, we need to know how many elements were in the
     * container BEFORE the append operation, and this becomes the offset to
     * be applied to the pointers of the newly appended elements.
