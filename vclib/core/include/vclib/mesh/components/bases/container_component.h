/**
 * @brief The ContainerComponent class is the base class for all the components
 * of VCLib that store a container of objects of a given type T.
 *
 * A component that inherits from this class will have all the features of the
 * @ref Component class, plus automatic storage of the data in a Container of
 * objects that could have static or dynamic size, and the possibility to tie
 * the size of the Container to the number of Vertices of the Element (E.g.
 * useful for some Face components like AdjacentFaces or WedgeTexCoords).
 *
 * For further details , please refer to the page @ref implement_component page.
 *
 * @tparam DerivedComponent: The type of the Derived Component. It is used to
 * implement the CRTP pattern.
 * @tparam COMPONENT_ID: The id of the component. It is a value of the enum
 * ComponentIDEnum, or an integer value that is not already used by any other
 * component. It is used to identify the component at compile time.
 * @tparam T: The type of the data that the component needs to store in a
 * Container. E.g. a WedgeTexCoord component would have vcl::TexCoordd as
 * DataType.
 * @tparam N: The size of the container: if >= 0 the size is static, if < 0 the
 * size is dynamic.
 * @tparam AdditionalData: the type of additional data that could be stored
 * outside the Container. If you don't have additional data. set AdditionalData
 * = void. E.g. a WedgeTexCoord component stores a short as AdditionalData that
 * indicates the texture index used by all the Wedge TexCoords.
 * @tparam ParentElemType: The Parent Element type is used to get access to the
 * Element that has the component (and, in case, to the Mesh that has the
 * Element). If the component doesn't need to access the Element, this type can
 * be void. Note: if the component is vertical (or optional), this type cannot
 * be void.
 * @tparam VERT: Boolean that tells if the component is vertical. If the
 * component is vertical, this parameter must be true. Note: to be vertical,
 * this parameter must be true, and ElementType must be the type of the Element
 * that has the component (the 'parent' Element Type).
 * @tparam OPT: When a component is vertical, it could be optional, that means
 * that could be enabled/disabled at runtime. To make the component optional,
 * this template parameter must be true.
 * @tparam TTVN: "Tied To Vertex Number", this boolean tells whether the
 * component should leave liberty to control the size of the Container to the
 * user, or it should be tied to the vertex number and changed automatically
 * when the number of vertices changes. E.g. a WedgeTexCoord component is a
 * Container that should be tied to the vertex number, meaning that the number
 * of texture coordinates should be always be the same of the number of
 * vertices. Setting this value to true will tie the size of this container to
 * the number of vertices.
 * @tparam PointedTypes: Variadic Template types of all the Pointer types that
 * the component stores, and that need to be updated when some reallocation
 * happens.
