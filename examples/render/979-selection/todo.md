## TODO
- Edge selection (This may not be possible yet because @bigmat is still working on a proper edge implementation)
- Maybe change code so that the selection box uniform is already in NDC space?
- Some way to manage the copying of buffers to texture given buffers that exceed textureMaxSize*textureMaxSize. (multiple textures? same texture blitted multiple times (each time requires 2 frames though)? who knows.)
- Selection buffers copy to selection flags on primitive (and buffers initialized from those)
- Further restrict Projection Matrix for visible face selection by intersecting the current selection box with the window space box generated by the circumscribed sphere of the union of the bounding boxes of the objects that are NOT outside of the window
