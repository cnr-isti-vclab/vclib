- Repeated automation action ?
- Automation action sequence ? (definitely needs to be done if point above is done)
- Time delay automation action ?
- Frame delay automation action ?
- put "m" before member variables in classes
- FIX reset_trackball_automation_h
- add "relevancy" to BenchmarkDrawer class when you add an action, so that you
    can choose whether to measure the framerate of the action or not
