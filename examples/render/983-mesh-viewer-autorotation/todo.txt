- Repeated automation action ?
- Automation action sequence ? (definitely needs to be done if point above is done)
- MeshChangerAutomationAction multiple meshes?
- put "m" before member variables in classes
- Create some "Metric" classes that measure what is needed when executing actions for the BenchmarkDrawer.
- Create some "Printer" classes that write the measured benchmarks wherever
- Automation that changes Metric or Printer (But mostly metric, changing printer seems a lot less useful)
- BUG: first automation is always worse than all the others (BenchmarkDrawer)
    SOLUTION: wait a few frames before starting (TEST ON VARIOUS DEVICES WHETHER THE AMOUNT YOU PUT IS GOOD ENOUGH).
- FileBenchmarkPrinter subclass of BenchmarkPrinter that has fileName, toPrint and stream and implements everything except
    for onBenchmarkLoop and print which remain pure virtual
- AutomationActionGroup initializer list
