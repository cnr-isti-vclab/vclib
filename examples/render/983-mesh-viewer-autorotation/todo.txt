- Repeated automation action ?
- MeshChangerAutomationAction multiple meshes?
- put "m" before member variables in classes
- Automation that changes Metric or Printer (But mostly metric, changing printer seems a lot less useful)
- FileBenchmarkPrinter subclass of BenchmarkPrinter that has fileName, toPrint and stream and implements everything except
    for onBenchmarkLoop and print which remain pure virtual
