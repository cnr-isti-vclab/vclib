First group: Uber shader

Second group: Split shaders

Third group: Uber-if shader

Every 6 measurements of each group belong to a different execution

Of those 6 measurements:
    - 1 and 4 are one rotation around Z axis in 1k frames
    - 2 and 5 are one rotation around Y axis in 1k frames
    - 3 and 6 are one rotation arount X axis in 1k frames

TODO: 
    split the result files in 3 (one per group) and 
    change the printer to print separately on those files by 
    itself (without having to put them in there manually).
    Possibly gather more data.
